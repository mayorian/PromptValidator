# ⚡ PROMPT VALIDATOR  
### Measure your prompts before the model does.

> Stop guessing. Start engineering.

## 🧠 The Rocket Introduction!

**Prompt Validator** is a real-time, static syntax analysis engine for Large Language Model prompts.

It inspects your prompt *before* it reaches an LLM and evaluates:

- Instruction strength  
- Signal density  
- Ambiguity  
- Structural clarity  
- Token footprint  

All inside a live, zero-backend, browser-based interface.

No API calls.  
No model execution.  
No cost.

Just signal.

## 🔬 Core Philosophy

Most AI failures are not model failures.  
They are **prompt architecture failures**.

Weak verbs.  
Missing constraints.  
Conversational filler.  
Conflicting instructions.

Prompt Validator transforms prompt writing from trial-and-error into measurable engineering.

## 🛰️ Real-Time Signal Mapping

Every word you type is analyzed and categorized into impact layers:

| Impact Level      | Meaning |
|-------------------|----------|
| 🔴 HIGH_IMPACT    | Directive, constraint-defining, outcome-shaping language |
| 🟠 MEDIUM_IMPACT  | Contextual guidance and framing |
| 🔵 LOW_IMPACT     | Weak, ambiguous, or low-signal wording |

The system computes a dynamic **Clarity Score (0–100%)** based on:

- Weighted instruction density  
- Impact distribution  
- Prompt length normalization  
- Directive entropy  

You don’t just write prompts.  
You see their structural integrity.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

When building:

- System prompts  
- Agent frameworks  
- RAG pipelines  
- Structured output chains  
- Evaluation harnesses  
- Guardrail logic  

Prompt reliability becomes critical.

Prompt Validator gives you visibility into prompt strength **before deployment**.

It’s a linting layer for AI language.
